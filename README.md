# Analyzing-a-Graph-using-Rust
I used Rust to create and analyze a graph made from a dataset of twitter friends. The graph was created using the module petgraph. I looked at the average degrees of seperation between one node and another by sampling nodes and the friendship paradox by selecting two nodes containing an undirected edge and determining whether the original node has less friends on average than its counterpart by sampling nodes.
